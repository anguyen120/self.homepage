[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/88644866-a46d-4a72-a17e-2c8ade79a902/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/alannguyen/deploys)

[alannguyen.dev](https://alannguyen.dev/) is my personal website using Hugo, a static website generator. I used the following Hugo themes:
 - [Hugrid](https://github.com/aerohub/hugrid)
 - [Lodi Theme](https://github.com/xaviablaza/hugo-lodi-theme)

It is also mobile-friendly. I can seamless push changes onto this repository's master branch and Netlify automatically deploys for me.

## To-do
 - Correctly integrate Hugrid
 - Add contact form
